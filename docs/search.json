In my work, I apply my expertise\r\n            in data science, utilizing programming languages such as R\r\n            and Python to process and analyze data, including spatial\r\n            data, which is often my primary focus. Additionally, I have\r\n            a deep interest in technology, particularly in exploring\r\n            Linux as the operating system I frequently use for various\r\n            computational tasks. Outside of work, I balance my life by\r\n            playing music, especially the guitar, and staying active\r\n            through running. This combination of interests in\r\n            technology, music, and sports helps me grow both\r\n            professionally and personally.
